## About The Project
ThThis is an exercise in understaning Django 

Here's what in it:
* A fully functioning blog: you will be able to create, update, and delete blog posts. Posts will have categories that can be used to sort them. Finally, users will be able to leave comments on posts.
* A portfolio of my work: a gallery style page with clickable links to projects that youâ€™ve completed.

Of course, this not completed and will be updated every now and then :)
